# prototypes
--> these are test interface with each having new features or look

# to create your own model
step1 - collect_imgs.py          >>> capture img for the model
step2 - create_dataset.py        >>> detect the hand landmarks and store it
step3 - train_classifier.py      >>> create and store prediction model dataset
step4 - inference_classifier.py  >>> test the model using webcam
